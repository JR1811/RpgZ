# RpgZ by [GloboxZ](https://github.com/Globox1997)
RpgZ changes the looting way of Minecraft. Instead of dropping items after getting killed, loot the corpse.

### Installation
RpgZ is a mod built for the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/). It requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) to be installed separately; all other dependencies are installed with the mod.

### Addition by [ShiroJR](https://github.com/JR1811)
This feature adds an additional check to the Body interaction. Therefore an additional dependency has been added to handle the original feature, such as tag and config handling, in the Fabric [NeMuelch-1.18](https://github.com/JR1811/NeMuelch-1.18) Mod.
